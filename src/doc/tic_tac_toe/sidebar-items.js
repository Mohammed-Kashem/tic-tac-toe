The player that succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. The game can be played on a physical grid with X’s and O’s or digitally, using Rust code. The code for Rust tic tac toe  consists of a main function that calls a game loop, which handles player turns and game state. It also includes a draw_board  function that displays the game board and a winner_check function that determines if a player has won. The game loop handles all game logic, including taking turns, drawing the board, checking for a winner, and keeping track of game state.  The game loop will end when either a player wins or the board is filled without a winner, at which point the program will print the result."]],"struct":[["InvalidMove",""]]};
